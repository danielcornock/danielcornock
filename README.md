### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently the front end & product lead at [@crowdcomms](https://github.com/crowdcomms).

I specialise in Angular and TypeScript, with a keen interest in front end architecture and unit testing.

I also dabble in back-end technologies from time to time, specifically using NodeJS framework NestJS to make APIs for my personal projects.
